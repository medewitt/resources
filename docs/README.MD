# Purpose

The motivated reason for this repo/ website is to help me keep all my resources organized and in one place. Yes, I have a blog, which fills the roles of some personal exercise, but I want something additional. Imagine this as a more heavily curated blog with example and easy access to some key resources that I may use over and over again. At least, that is my vision.
