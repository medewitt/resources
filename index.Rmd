The purpose of this website is to provide a consolidated location for tools, tutorials, examples, and resources commonly used in my research. This includes items such as data sets to more complicated tests of models and methods. The purpose of this website is primarily as a personal tool to provide quick access to these items, but I wanted to make it available if anyone else sees a use in it.

All presentations, video, and supporting resources will be hosted here. IF you have any questions about the materials, please e-mail [me](mailto:dewittme@wfu.edu).
